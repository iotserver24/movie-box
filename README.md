# Movie Box

An ad-free Flutter Android client with a self-hostable Python catalog and playback API, created by **[R3AP3R Editz](https://github.com/iotserver24)**.

Browse and search titles, resume watching, save bookmarks, and download media for offline playback where you have permission to do so. The client talks to the scraper API; the API returns metadata and media links rather than proxying video.

> **Source-available, with conditions:** You may use, modify, and share this project under the [custom license](LICENSE). Keep proper credit to R3AP3R Editz, never add ads, and never sell the project or its derivatives or charge for access. Because these restrictions limit reuse, this is not OSI-approved open source. [Licensing details](docs/licensing.md).

**[Donate to support the creator](https://ai.xibebase.in)** — donations are optional and do not unlock features or access. The destination is the creator's XibeCode-branded support page; review its donor-publicity notice before donating. See [donation privacy](docs/privacy.md#donations).

## Features

- Home sections, catalog browsing, search suggestions, and title details.
- Video playback with available quality and subtitle choices.
- Continue Watching with saved episode and playback position.
- A bookmarked-title library and offline playback of saved downloads.
- Download progress and partial-file resume on retry.
- A configurable API address and optional bearer-token authentication.
- A Docker Compose deployment bound to localhost by default.
- Offline creator-credit and project-license screens, plus dependency notices in Settings.

**Current scope:** Android is the checked-in application target. Downloads run only while the app remains open. Upstream catalog availability, signed links, subtitle availability, and quality restrictions can change; this project does not bypass locked content.

## Quick start

You need Git, Docker with the Compose plugin, and **Flutter 3.47.5 stable (Dart 3.13.4)**, plus the Android development tools. See [setup and troubleshooting](docs/setup.md) for the local Python alternative and device networking.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iotserver24/movie-box.git
cd movie-box
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build -d
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Copy `.env.example` only on first setup so existing configuration is not overwritten. Repository access is required while the repository is private. In another terminal, from the repository root:

```sh
cd movie_box_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

In the app's **Settings**, change the API address to your own server. For the standard Android emulator, use `http://10.0.2.2:8000`. A physical device needs a reachable private LAN/VPN address and the matching API token. The app currently defaults to `https://movie-box.n92dev.us.kg`; this repository does not guarantee that deployment's availability or privacy practices. Do not enter your own server's token until you have selected your own server address.

Set a strong `SCRAPER_API_TOKEN` before making the API reachable beyond localhost. Prefer a private VPN; use HTTPS for any remote hostname. Never commit `.env` or share tokens in issues.

## Development checks

With the Python development environment configured as described in [setup](docs/setup.md):

```sh
python -m pytest scraper/tests -q
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -v
python scripts/sync_notices.py --check
```

From `movie_box_app/`:

```sh
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug
```

These are commands to run locally, not claims that a particular revision has passed them. See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request. Feature requests and reproducible non-sensitive bugs belong in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/iotserver24/movie-box/issues).

## Project layout

```text
movie_box_app/   Flutter Android application and widget tests
scraper/         FastAPI service, provider adapter, and Python tests
compose.yaml     Local Docker Compose deployment
script.py        Standalone experimental downloader; not needed by the app
docs/           Setup, architecture, privacy, licensing, and release guidance
```

`script.py` contains a hard-coded download example and starts network/download work when executed; it is not the app's entry point or a setup step.
